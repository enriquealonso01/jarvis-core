# Git Bash on Windows rewrites anything shaped like a unix path in an argument
# into a Windows path, so `-e JARVIS_FAKE_MODEL_SCRIPT=/app/scripts/...` reached
# the container as `C:/Program Files/Git/app/scripts/...`. The fixture then
# failed to load, the fake model answered with nothing, and the suite reported a
# product failure ("no reviewer route answered") for a bug that was entirely in
# the shell. It cost an afternoon twice. Suites must not depend on which shell
# started them.
